# IETF-105-Mtg-Network-BoF
Ideas for a BoF at IETF 105 on IETF meeting network requirements

1 - Do we need to manage connectivity for all of the guest rooms?
2 - What are the key NOC functions and does it need to be as fully staffed as it is now (with a paid NOC manager)?
3 - Can we prioritize key network functions into must have vs. nice to have (optional)?
4 - Can we simplify or eliminate any key requirements?
